                    The group deliberated for a little while and ultimately decided on a per delivery app! See the details below:
                </summary>
                    No unfinished business from <em>last</em> meeting, so we are able to move forward with <i>current</i> meeting! <br>
                    New team meeting time discussed to be 12PM three times a week on Mon, Wed, Fri. So next topic will be discussed<br><hr>
                
                    Ideas for group app project were diverse with a music and video app, which can only play one song and video (found here): <br>
                    <video width="320" height="240" controls><source src="videoplayback.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <br>
                    The audio can be found here: <br>
                    <img src="images.jpg" alt="rick-roll"> <br>
                    <audio controls> <source src="videoplayback.mp4" type="audio/mpeg"> </audio> <br>
                    The group decided against this idea though and went with another app idea which is like uber but for purchasing pets. <br> <hr>

                Meeting etiquette was discussed so that everyone understands that meetings should be informative, concise and fun! <br>
                Everyone is expected to understand what is happening with the project and to act professionally when discussing the project. <br>
